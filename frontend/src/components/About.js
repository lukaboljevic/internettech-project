                My name is <strong>Luka Boljevic.</strong> I'm currently finishing my
                third year of Computer Science at the University of Montenegro. This
                website is one of my final projects.
            </p>

                I have loved computers ever since I was little. I remember my first video
                game being Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, at around 7 or 8 years old.
                Later on, I became interested in computer hardware, and at around 13 or
                14, if my memory serves me well, I built a computer from scratch,
                completely on my own. It took me 6-7 hours, but man, did it feel good when
                it was up and running.
            </p>

                During high school, I further developed my passion towards computers in
                general, and especially towards computer science and programming. It's one
                of a few areas in which I could see myself in the future. I love gaming, I
                love talking about computers, I love building computers... I just love
                computers =D. However, most of the stuff related to computer science
                though, back when I was 16 or 17, seemed scary, and extremely complicated.
                As weird as it sounds, that's one of the reasons why I wanted to get into
                Computer Science.

            <p className="about-me smaller">
                I've honestly always had some doubt in myself, thinking I won't be able to
                finish my university, and that I won't be able to learn what I want. In my
                primary school days, I was often bullied for being the "smart guy". It's
                not how it's supposed to be, but that's how it was, and being the
                introvert I was back then, it really did shatter my confidence going
                forward. On top of that, I had little to no <em>good</em> friends to
                "complain" to, or to listen to me out when it was hard.
            </p>
            <p className="about-me smaller">
                Coming into high school, I met new people, that I still hang out to this
                day, that helped me sky rocket my confidence and become less of an
                introvert. And well, fast forward a few years, here I am, successfully
                finishing my bachelor degree, and completely from scratch building my
                first website. It's not the greatest idea by any stretch of the
                imagination, it's not the prettiest site, but it's mine, and I'm proud of
                it. I can quite confidently say that I have overcome my fears and doubts,
                that I have found what I want to do in life, and that I have laid a solid
                foundation for that. From this point on, I only want to learn more, work
                harder, and be better at something I once thought I was never going to be
                able to do.
            </p>
            <p className="about-me smaller">
                As a finishing note, I just want to say, to whoever is reading is: if you
                ever think there is something you can't do, can't overcome or can't
                achieve, working hard, believing in yourself, and most importantly,
                surrounding yourself with the right people <strong>will</strong>, at one
                point or another, get you to your destination. You mustn't give up. I know
                it's a cliche saying, but from my experience, it really is true:{" "}
                <strong>
                    work hard and it <em>will</em> pay off
                </strong>
                .
            </p>
