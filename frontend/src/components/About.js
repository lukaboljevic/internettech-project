                My name is <strong>Luka Boljevic.</strong> I'm currently finishing my
                third year of Computer Science at the University of Montenegro. This
                website is one of my final projects.

                I have loved computers ever since I was little. I remember my first video
                game being Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, at around 7 or 8 years old.
                Later on, I became interested in computer hardware, and at around 13 or
                14, if my memory serves me well, I built a computer from scratch,
                completely on my own. It took me 6-7 hours, but man, did it feel good when
                it was up and running.

                During high school, I further developed my passion towards computers in
                general, and especially towards computer science and programming. It's one
                of a few areas in which I could see myself in the future. I love gaming, I
                love talking about computers, I love building computers... I just love
                computers =D. However, most of the stuff related to computer science
                though, back when I was 16 or 17, seemed scary, and extremely complicated.
                As weird as it sounds, that's one of the reasons why I wanted to get into
                Computer Science.

                Fast forward a few years, here I am, successfully finishing my bachelor
                degree, and completely from scratch building my first website. It's not
                the greatest idea by any stretch of the imagination, it's not the
                prettiest site, but it's mine, and I'm proud of it. I can quite
                confidently say that this is something I want to pursue in life, and that
                I can certainly see myself working as a full stack developer in the
                relatively near future.
