                        Have you ever wanted to experience the absolute power of a gaming
                        machine, but never had the money to buy one?

                        You've come to the right place. Here, you can find your favourite
                        machine - a PC, PS4, Xbox, PS5, Nintendo Switch, you name it.

                        Best of all - there may just be someone close to you who is
                        willing to let you try it out.

                        Look for the hardware of your dreams and try it out. We serve as a
                        middleman, a place for you to search what you want, and get the
                        items that fit your budget and needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After you have found what you want, create an account. It's really
                        simple and quick, it only takes a minute or two. You will then be
                        able to rent your item.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can then super legitimately pay with your credit card, or just
                        pay upon arrival. Then it's just a matter of waiting. Send me a
                        picture of the thing you rented on my Instagram!
