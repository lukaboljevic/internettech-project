A final exam project for the subject "Internet technologies". The goal is to model a site for renting computer equipment - PS, Xbox, 
PC, chairs, desks if you want, it doesn't really matter .

# Tech stack

- [DynamoDB database](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), for storing item and rent history information; 
- [Express server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), for exposing the API to the frontend
- [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), for searching items from the database
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), for user authentication and file storage
- [React](https://reactjs.org/), for the frontend/site itself

# Setup (coming soon)
